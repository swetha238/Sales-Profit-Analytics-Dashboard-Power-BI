# Sales & Profit Analytics Dashboard – Power BI

A Power BI dashboard for sales performance analysis. It includes:

## Problem Statement
The business needed a clear and interactive way to track overall sales performance, identify high-margin products, evaluate revenue contributions by sales channels, and understand geographic patterns in profitability.  
Existing reports were static and lacked the ability to drill into specifics like customer-level revenue or channel-level profitability.

## What We Did
We built a Power BI dashboard that integrates key sales, product, channel, and geographic data into a single interactive report.  
Our work involved:
- Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- Designing KPIs for revenue, profit, profit margin %, orders, and revenue per order.
- Creating visuals for seasonal trends, sales growth, and order value distributions.
- Mapping geographic sales and profit data at both state and region levels.
- Comparing channel performance with profitability metrics.

## What We Understood & Insights
From the analysis, we identified several key findings:
- **Seasonality**: Revenue peaks around March, June, and September, suggesting cyclical demand patterns.
- **Product Performance**: A small subset of products drives a majority of the revenue, while others yield higher profit margins despite lower sales.
- **Channel Analysis**: Wholesale contributes the highest revenue share, but Export channels often have higher margins.
- **Geographic Insights**: California is the single largest revenue contributor, while the West region leads in profit margins.
- **Customer Insights**: A few customers are responsible for a significant proportion of total revenue, indicating dependency on top accounts.

- **Executive Overview & Trends**: KPIs (Total Revenue, Total Profit, Profit Margin %, Total Orders, Revenue per Order), monthly revenue rhythm, sales trends, order value spectrum, and a price vs. margin map.
- **Product & Channel Performance**: best‑selling products, high‑margin products, profitability vs. revenue scatter, revenue split by channel, profit pipeline by channel, and a channel efficiency scorecard.
- **Geographic & Customer Insights**: top customers and states by revenue, revenue by region, profit margin by region, and a US profit map.
